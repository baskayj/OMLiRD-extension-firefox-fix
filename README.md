This extension adds a convenient context menu option to quickly open magnet links in Real-Debrid’s torrent page. Simply right-click on a magnet link and choose “Open in Real-Debrid” to automatically redirect to Real-Debrid and start the process of resolving the torrent. If the link is not a magnet link, a helpful notification will let you know.

Perfect for users who regularly use Real-Debrid to access torrents seamlessly and efficiently :)
