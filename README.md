# Open magnet links in Real-Debrid
[Download here](https://github.com/f1shpie/OMLiRD-chrome-extension/releases/latest)

This extension adds a convenient context menu option to quickly open magnet links in Real-Debrid’s torrent page. Simply right-click on a magnet link and choose “Open in Real-Debrid” to automatically redirect to Real-Debrid and start the process of resolving the torrent. If the link is not a magnet link, a helpful notification will let you know.

Perfect for users who regularly use Real-Debrid to access torrents seamlessly and efficiently :)

Once approved I'll post the Chrome extension link.
